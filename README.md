# Git-Github-Tutorial

Day-1 :

What is GIT?

Git has multiple full forms but I will go with the standard "Global Information Tracker" which is a "Version Control System" used to manage and track the versions of our code locally. Typically we would not start a task and complete it within a day, it takes days or weeks to complete. So, to locally manage our code or to maintain each version of our code we use GIT.

GIT ----> Local source code management

Versions ----> Checkpoints for our code, like saving the progress of games played in video games, we use GIT for code progress and management.

GIT was founded by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux in 2005.


Day-2:

What is GitHub?

GitHub is a central repository for all the repos and commits you tend to do. GitHub is a cloud version of GIT with UI features, git manages the code locally and GitHub is a cloud tool that allows you to manage, share and collaborate code publically.

GitHub ----> web-based platform for version control and collaboration

GitHub was founded by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon in the year 2007.
