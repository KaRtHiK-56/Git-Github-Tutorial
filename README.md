What is GIT?
Git has multiple fullforms but i will go with the standard one "Global Information Tracker" which is a "Version Control System" that is used to manage and track the versions of our code locally. Typically we would not start a task and complete it with in a day, it takes days or weeks to complete. So, to locally manage our code or to mainain each versions of our code we use GIT.

GIT ----> Local source code management
Versions ----> Check points for our code, like saving our progress of game played in video games , we se GIT for code progress and management.
