Day-1 :

What is GIT?
Git has multiple full forms but I will go with the standard "Global Information Tracker" which is a "Version Control System" used to manage and track the versions of our code locally. Typically we would not start a task and complete it within a day, it takes days or weeks to complete. So, to locally manage our code or to maintain each version of our code we use GIT.

GIT ----> Local source code management

Versions ----> Checkpoints for our code, like saving the progress of games played in video games, we use GIT for code progress and management.

GIT was founded by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux in 2005.
